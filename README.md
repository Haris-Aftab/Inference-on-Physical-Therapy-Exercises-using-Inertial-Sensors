Final year computer science project at the University of Exeter on inference on physical therapy exercises using inertial sensors.

Abstract
The utilization of physical therapy exercises constitutes a potent modality for rehabilitating the mobility and functional capacity of individuals suffering from a diverse array of impairments stemming
from disability, illness, or injury. However, their success is contingent upon the patient’s ability to adhere to the prescribed guidelines of the physical therapy routines. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
are a device that employs accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to accurately measure and
report the motion of a body. A patient’s ability to accurately execute physical therapy exercises can be
facilitated through the use of IMUs. Our objective is to leverage machine learning techniques such as
Support Vector Machines to classify and evaluate the physical therapy exercises performed using data
gathered from these devices. To accomplish this, we have conducted an in-depth analysis using data
acquired from the PHYTMO database, which comprises inertial data from 30 volunteers performing
six exercises with varying degrees of form correctness. In this report, we also investigate the efficacy
of different window lengths and overlaps, and evaluate their impact on model performance. Through
experimentation, we determined that a window length of 4 seconds and 25% overlap resulted in the
highest accuracy rate of 95.5%. The success of the project will be determined by the implementation
of rigorous evaluation techniques, which will allow for a comprehensive comparison of results with
previous, comparable studies.
